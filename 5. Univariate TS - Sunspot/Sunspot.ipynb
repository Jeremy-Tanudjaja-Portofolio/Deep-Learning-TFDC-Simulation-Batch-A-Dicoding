input time series data series and adds a new axis at the end of the data. This reshapes the data to have an additional dimension, which is often required when working with TensorFlow.\n","\n","2. tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(series): This creates a TensorFlow Dataset from the input data series. A dataset in TensorFlow is a sequence of elements that can be iterated over.\n","\n","3. ds.window(window_size + 1, shift=1, drop_remainder=True): This creates a \"windowed\" dataset. It splits the data into overlapping windows of size window_size + 1 (the +1 is used to include both the input and target values for a prediction). The shift=1 parameter specifies that the windows should slide by one element at a time. drop_remainder=True means that any window that doesn't have enough elements to form a complete window of size window_size + 1 will be dropped.\n","\n","4. ds.flat_map(lambda w: w.batch(window_size + 1)): The flat_map operation is used to flatten the windows created in the previous step. Each window is converted into a batch of window_size + 1 elements. This prepares the data for creating input and target pairs for prediction.\n","\n","5. ds.shuffle(shuffle_buffer): This shuffles the dataset. The parameter shuffle_buffer determines how many elements in the dataset should be kept in a buffer, and TensorFlow randomly samples elements from this buffer to create a shuffled dataset. Shuffling is often done to introduce randomness during training, which can help the model generalize better.\n","\n","6. ds.map(lambda w: (w[:-1], w[1:])): This maps each element in the dataset to a tuple containing two parts. The first part, w[:-1], represents the input sequence, excluding the last element. The second part, w[1:], represents the target sequence, excluding the first element. This is a common approach for creating input-target pairs for sequence prediction tasks.\n","\n","7. return ds.batch(batch_size).prefetch(1): Finally, the dataset is batched into batches of size batch_size. Batching is a common practice in machine learning to process multiple examples simultaneously, which can improve training efficiency. The prefetch(1) operation helps to improve data loading performance by prefetching the next batch of data, allowing the GPU or CPU to work on the current batch without waiting for data loading1"],"metadata":{"id":"EUA0VaTzSjQ3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_set=windowed_dataset(train_series, window_size=window_size,batch_size=batch_size, shuffle_buffer=shuffle_buffer_size)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-fjbr-msWfSd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697541934478,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":314,"user":{"displayName":"Jeremy Tanudjaja","userId":"08784333553463389850"}},"outputId":"efe5e792-97f9-42eb-e332-c7eb9a562471"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["tf.Tensor(\n","[[0.24284279]\n"," [0.26192868]\n"," [0.29306881]\n"," [0.23304872]\n"," [0.35585133]], shape=(5, 1), dtype=float64)\n","<_TensorSliceDataset element_spec=TensorSpec(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float64, name=None)>\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Create the model"],"metadata":{"id":"Jt99GUWdYtYO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n","    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(window_size, kernel_size=1, input_shape=[None,1], activation='relu'),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),\n","    # YOUR CODE HERE.\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)\n","])"],"metadata":{"id":"bXJT_JBUYvMu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='adam', metrics=['mae'])"],"metadata":{"id":"JL_b-7wHZHT-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.fit(train_set, epochs = 500)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Z9KzTlkjZQaO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697542826760,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":690659,"user":{"displayName":"Jeremy Tanudjaja","userId":"08784333553463389850"}},"outputId":"7e647492-2dcd-422a-f446-0a229decd22e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/500\n","93/93 [==============================] -
